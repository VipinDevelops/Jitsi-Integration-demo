## Jitsi Meet x Rocket.Chat Integration Demo 
This project is a demo of an integration between Jitsi Meet and Rocket.Chat, aimed at enhancing the chat functionality of Jitsi Meet. The embedded version of Rocket.Chat provides a rich messaging experience with full chat history retention after the conference.

The goal of this project is to extend the <JitsiMeeting/> tag with a useRCForChat attribute in the Jitsi Meet React SDK. The integration will maintain prosody as the single source of truth for channel membership and cater to a variety of server authentication scenarios, including SSO and OAuth.
